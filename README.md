# Memento-Mori
A game made 7 months ago in the second year of my Computer Science (Games) course. This was the main project for my Games Design and Development module.
My focus was on programming which is why the graphics/sound/everything else are a little... rough.

This game was developed using version 2020.3.19f1 of the Unity editor so if you want it to be fully working (kind of) when you open it, you will need to use this version of Unity.

Also included is a .exe of the game in the Memento Mori Build folder in case you just want to play it instead of edit it.

This project is extremely unoptimised and has a lot of very large binary files in it - the size of this repo is about 3.5GB - so be prepared for a possibly lengthy wait if you want to download the project. Git LFS was used for all the really large files.
