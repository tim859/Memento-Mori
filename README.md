# Memento-Mori
A game made in the second year of my Computer Science (Games) course. This was the main project for my Games Design and Development module.
My focus was on programming which is why the graphics/sound/everything else are a little... rough.

This was developed using version 2020.3.19f1 of the Unity editor so if you want to be fully working when you open it, you will need to use that version of Unity.

Also included is a .exe of the game in the Memento Mori Build folder in case you just want to play it instead of edit it.
